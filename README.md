# ruby-solutions-beecrowd

Repository for submitting solutions for *beecrowd* or *URI*'s problems in **Ruby** programming language  

I made this repository to save my codes from beecrowd while studying *Ruby* and problem solving. If you're walking the same path as me and came across it somehow, i hope it could be useful to you.  

*obs.: Some variables name may be different from the ones of your exercise depending on the language you're acessing the platform, so pay attention to this if you're having problems.*
