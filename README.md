I made this repository to save my codes from beecrowd while studying **Ruby** and practicing problem solving for technical interviews. If you're walking the same path as me and came across it somehow, i hope it could be useful to you.  

*obs.: Some variables name and words in the answers may be different from the ones of your exercises depending on the language you're acessing the platform, so pay attention to this if you're having problems.*
